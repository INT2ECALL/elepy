## About Elypi

Elepy is a Rest API generation tool for Java/Kotlin developed by Ryan Susana. It is extremely customizable! The library comes bundled with an admin control panel that lets you easily control your content.

Because it's backed by MongoDB, it's able to handle extremely complex objects with ease.

Every part of the generation library is customizable. That means that you can use Elepy to handle really complicated application logic as well.
